# CrystalCap: Time-Based Crystal Dielectric Capacitor

**CrystalCap** is a speculative physics and materials project simulating a **crystal-based analogue memory cell**. Inspired by recent research into **altermagnetism**, **spin-based energy transfer**, and **psychophysical resonance**, this system explores how dielectric properties of engineered crystals can dynamically respond to sound, thought, or magnetic stimuli — effectively storing information across time.

## 🌌 Concept

Conventional capacitors store energy based on electric field separation. In **CrystalCap**, dielectric permittivity is not fixed but evolves in time as a function of external stimulus (e.g. voice, waveform, magnetic field, or intention). The result is an **analogue memory unit** — a capacitor whose storage capacity encodes signal history in its own material state.

This prototype is part of a broader inquiry into:

- Conscious-material interfaces  
- Time-resonant energy storage  
- Post-symbolic computation
